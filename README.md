# Console Batteship Game

Console Project for a simple Battleship game in C#. The project involved setting up a 10x10, 20x20 or 30x30 game board, placing ships of different sizes, and allowing players (PVP or PVE) to take turns guessing coordinates to sink the opponent's fleet. I utilized a 2D array to represent the game board, with characters for water and ships. Implement a game loop that continues until all ships are sunk, displaying the board and prompting players for input in each turn. I added logic to check for hits and misses, updating the board accordingly. Once all enemy ships were sunk, I displayed a winning message. This project was an excellent opportunity to practice array manipulation, user input handling, and basic game logic in C#.
